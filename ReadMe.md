# **SUFI (SUmo-based Fault Injector)**


SUFI is a sumo-based fault injector tool. The tool consists of [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). SUFI uses sumo for mobility simulation, where we define the traffic scenario and vehicle features there. Also, sumo allows us to select the car-following and lane-changing models to model the car behavior during the simulation run, thereby, evaluate these models through the fault and attack injection.
