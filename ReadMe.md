# **SUFI (SUmo-based Fault Injector)**


SUFI is a [sumo](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/)-based fault injector tool. It uses sumo for mobility simulation, where the traffic scenario and vehicle features are defined there. Also, sumo allows us to select the car-following and lane-changing models to model the car behavior during simulation, therefore, evluate the through the fault injection.
